This arrow mod for the game Minecraft makes it so if an arrow that is on fire collides with a block, it sets the block alight. This works for lighting Nether Portals, Campfires, and TNT as well. 
Note: The arrow only has to be on fire, so Flame enchanted bows will work, or shooting an arrow through lava will also meet the condition.
